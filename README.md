###Steven Shi, Alex Song, & Michael Marion

####Project Dates
We began the project on Thursday, September 12 and finished the project on Sunday, September 22nd. We worked on this project for approximately twenty hours.

####Link to Repository.
Our repository may be found at [https://github.com/duke-compsci308-fall2013/springies_team15](https://github.com/duke-compsci308-fall2013/springies_team15).

####Roles and Responsibilities
We did our best to work together in person on the code, but from time to time we worked separately. Most key design decisions were made as a group.

- Michael developed most of the underlying structure and helped implement the basic design, in addition to assisting Steven in writing methods across all classes.
- Steven implemented most of the logic behind masses, springs and global forces, in addition to writing most of the parser code.
- Alex refactored a lot of the code into new classes to avoid "if" statements.

####Start Files
The Main class is located in the default package. Run this class to run Springies.

####Resource Files
The program parses data from XML files located in the /assets directory. 

####Running the Program
Upon running main, the user should press the 'n' key to bring up a dialog box. This allows the user to select an XML file which will be parsed by the program and rendered in the simulation. 

**Note:** the user should first parse the *environment.xml* file to fill the simulation with global forces before adding assemblies to the simulation.

To add an assembly, press 'n' again to bring up a dialog. Example assembly files are given in the /assets directory.
